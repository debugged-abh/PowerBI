# PowerBI

I have developed a comprehensive U.S. Hospitals Infographics Dashboard utilizing Power BI. This dashboard serves as a platform to present detailed information pertaining to various hospitals across all 50 states. The dashboard is intelligently structured into three distinct sections to enhance usability and facilitate effective data exploration:

Home Page: The primary landing page of the dashboard offers users the ability to select a specific state and subsequently choose a hospital from within the selected state. Upon making these selections, the dashboard dynamically generates and presents an array of visually appealing and informative visuals related to the chosen state and hospital. To provide users with additional insights, buttons are conveniently placed on the interface, which, when clicked, offer concise contextual information regarding the selected state and hospital.

State Info Page: This section of the dashboard is dedicated to presenting a concise yet comprehensive overview of the selected state. Users can access this page to obtain pertinent information about the state, such as population statistics, healthcare infrastructure, and notable health indicators. By condensing relevant data into easily digestible formats, users can quickly gain a comprehensive understanding of the state's healthcare landscape.

Hospital Info Page: Designed to provide users with focused insights, the Hospital Info page offers brief but pertinent information regarding the selected hospital. Users can access this page to explore details such as hospital specialization, accreditation status, bed capacity, and quality indicators. By presenting this information in a concise manner, users can efficiently assess the specific attributes and characteristics of the selected hospital.

By leveraging Power BI, I have successfully developed an intuitive and informative dashboard that allows users to explore comprehensive information regarding U.S. hospitals. The interface is strategically divided into the aforementioned sections, enabling users to seamlessly navigate and access the desired information. This U.S. Hospitals Infographics Dashboard serves as a powerful tool for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers to gain valuable insights into the healthcare landscape across the United States.
